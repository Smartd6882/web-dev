        <p>Every few decades, the video production industry goes through a revolution that forever changes the way we work, and what we can achieve. It is thrilling to know that one is happening right now (and you can be part of it). For example, the industry
            largely abandoned analog cameras, video and transmission (in favor of digital systems) over a decade ago. This, in turn, paved the way for vastly more efficient non-linear workflows. Similarly, the explosion of the Internet and the widespread
            adoption of high speed networking set the stage for the next revolution. We confidently predict that, twenty years hence, it will be clear that this was far more profound and important than matters like resolution, frame-rate, and the like.

                We live in a world in which virtually every computer system in the world is potentially connected to every other one. Billions of these devices have high quality screens, fast processors and cameras. Ultimately, in this environment, it is inevitable that
                efficient, economical, non-linear video transfer in IP space will supersede traditional linear connection methods (SDI, HDMI, etc.) and systems.</article>
            NewTek NDI™ (Network Device Interface) makes it easy to share high-quality video over a local Ethernet network. However, the NDI vision is vastly exciting than any mere ’cable upgrade’</p>

    </h3>
    <p>Because it connects everyone and everything, everywhere together in non-linear fashion, the Internet is vastly more than a better way to move data from point to point. Thus it enabled and inspired innovators who truly changed the world in fundamental
        ways,
        <section>creating tools and workflows that use data in ways that noone had ever imagined. A similar quantum leap for video production is at hand. From the outset of the personal computer revolution, NewTek foresaw that video production would inevitably
            leverage the exponential progress of general computing. </section>
        <section> vision also embraces the commensurate advances in general purpose networking and the Internet. Production systems using IP to integrate data, video, and audio are transforming live video production yet again – in ways that would have seemed miraculous
            just a few years ago. NewTek’s mission is to give storytellers a voice through video, using innovation and technology to fundamentally change the way video is created and used.
        </section> NewTek NDI springs from these core values. We are providing it to the world for free to make it easy to connect video products over IP, in turn greatly expanding creative options for video producers – providing them with greater power,
        increased efficiency, and economy. This document will introduce NDI, inform you as to what it is, and how to get started using it right now.
